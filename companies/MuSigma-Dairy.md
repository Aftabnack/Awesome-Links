27th Aug 2018 to 31st Aug 2018

The calm before the storm? Halfway through writing the dairy. I erased all of it to write the final one directly on Tuesday.

Hi all,

It is with immense pleasure that I have started typing this. Bear with me this is going to be long. Recently I have noticed people have broken the trend of writing long mails, I will reignite it.

It is that time when I have to say goodbye to this company (not it's people). 3 years has been long, longer than what I had initially hoped. But I am extremely glad I stayed here for this long. MuSigma has been a perfect platform for me. And I will always be grateful for all these years and all the people that journeyed it along with me.

I represent a new breed of nerds (Nerds 2.0 if you will), who are not just good at nerding things out but are beginning to understand the intricacies about socializing, being around people. I won't just make sure you put a semicolon at the end of every statement you right; but also talk shit about indian politics and that crazy video I watched yesterday on youtube. I am crazy about football (Barca brand of football), I can tell you how Brynden Rivers came to become the "3 eyed raven" from being a bastard son of Aegon targeryan. I can argue with you on very interesting subjects like "The existence of Religion" etc.

I guess from tomorrow I won't miss The cafeteria food (and timings) Wearing formals Deciding where to go for lunch Bitching about MuSigma policies Staying up late into the night cuz you have to do something to unwind after work

Things that won't change My OCD about organizing my work mail/GMail etc My OCD about always nudging someone to write the most optimized code on day 1 Looking out for mind blowing new things in (React)JS world Updating my dependencies in all my personal and work projects when something new comes out DOCUMENTATION (specially as neatly bulleted points like this) My love for coding (and TV shows & football; never tried to rank them)

What I will miss is the people.

Raiyan: This guy has been my driving force in all that I did here (I don't think he knows this). I have always been amazed by all the amazing things he has done so far, and I have always strived to one up him (Have I won at last?? Maybe!!). Excellent friend (and roommate). Silently gives all the killer lines.

Varun: My kannada buddy. (I'm not being racist here, It's so hard to find people speaking kannada these days you know. Even people who know kannada won't talk to each other in kannada). Suprised by the amount of growth he has had from when he joined our team in MuRx as someone who didn't know coding. He is an integral part of what we have achieved in Phoenix Platform. Always puts the "Extra effort" (Saleem always used to keep telling him). Oh and won't forget our intense political discussion/arguments that went way over into the wee hours of morning!!

Hey! Just remembered! It's soooo coooool to call ourselves the Platform guys! Cheers to our old phoenix team!

Sachin: The most important part of our team specially after snacks time (he knows why, ask him!!). Oh and the sarcasm! He is also one of the few who tends to listen to my jokes completely in all the chit chatting noise around. Hard (and smart) worker. Excellent teammate!

Chepuri: The silent coder. You won't find any other person who will listen to every word you are saying very intently without interjecting in between! He is a genius at a very different wavelength than me. Hence was great to have him work on the UI framework with us. I always used to bounce ideas off of him! You will reach places bro! Keep at it!

Anand: My managers. Anand is the most memorable person to everyone who knows him. He is very compassionate with you, takes interest in what you are doing, whether you are arguing why "Android is better than iOS" or comes and asks you about how Barca lost the previous day's match! He is the best source of support you will find in the company. I don't think I would ever get such manager in any other company throughout my future career!

Srini: I will always be grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to work on the UI framework. Person who knows a lot of things about a lot of things. It is true what they say, whenever you are stuck with something, he will find a way out for you. Srini is a very particular about the work you do but also ends the day playing anti-chess/connect 4 with you.

Satyam: This is the guy that puts a smile on my face everyday! Always cheerful and sporty! You can literally talk bullshit with him for hours on end. Will miss having that aura around.

Anoop: The one from my college. Very smart and organized in the way he conducts himself and the way he codes. Always up for trolling Satyam whenever we want! I hope he continue our tradition of "Watch-Me-Leave" to satyam!

Sumanth: He is very organized in his thoughts and always takes first principle approach at looking at any problem. I think he was one of the people who were affected most by the initial days of UI framework since things were in a constant state of flux. And he would have to rethink everything again.

And to all others who I haven't mentioned here! Know this:




Also note that I have mentioned only people who are still in this company. Cuz all the others have "Grown Up". I'm pretty sure if I keep this open I will have more and more things to say. Let's end this here! Thank you for spending your time reading this (And you thought you won't be getting anything for reading this?) Do keep in touch! (Details in signature) This is me signing off!!!

PS: Our original agreed last day mail was to just send "HAHAHA.... <EOT>" in the subject line. Kinda overstepped it!

Thanks & Regards,

The one where your whole work life flashes by

Finally reached the state where most of my migration from Phoenix to React is done! Barring few minor glitches everything should be converted by the end of next week. I just hope someone will maintain my react-utils package and the fork of create-react-app after I go. You will get all sorts of help online for this.
Please take care of this!!

Plus both the projects can serve as a great starting point for any application that should be build with React!

Now is the time I start to go back in time and think about all the great many things I have achieved. And more importantly the chance given to me to do this! For all the quirks I have about mu sigma, nothing can take away the fact that this has been an excellent platform to groom myself the way I have. If the current me would have travelled back in time to when I joined Mu Sigma, I think I would exclaim Upon this Rock I build my church. This time period kinda reminds me of my last few college days where we were both unsure what the future holds and sad to leave the confines of this building where my Church (so to speak) is already thriving. ONLY CHANGE IS CONSTANT

13th Aug 2018 to 17th Aug 2018

Final barrage of heavy work! Converting whole phoenix UI framework code to ReactJS.
Too much mindfuckery going on. It's challenging as hell.
Doing too many things alone, and there is only me who has to do this.

Imagine it, I am burying my own UI framework into the ground! Emotionless!

6th Aug 2018 to 10th Aug 2018

Put down papers. Emotions deferred!

30th July 2018 to 3rd Aug 2018

Nothing special

July 2018
23rd July 2018 to 27th July 2018

Decent work week.

16th July 2018 to 20th July 2018

Decent work week.

9th July 2018 to 13th July 2018

Very personally taxing week. Too much stuff going on in office and outside. Friday I fell ill with cold, sneezing all throughout with my throbbing head, can't get anything done.
Figured out how to hookup gitlab ci to kubernetes finally. Will implement it next week. I'm exhausted!!

On another depressing note Happy Face Sandhya left the company today.. :) Very happy for her!! God bless!

2nd July 2018 to 6th July 2018

Finally wrapped up my journey with EoC. Started as a small tool to showcase in the Customer Summit 2017, EoC app really took off as it was built on a Good Idea..!
Throughout it's journey there were so many cooks who had spoiled the broth, but the end result today feels Useful, Beautiful in it's own weird way and Satisfying..
Although I won't ever be disassociated with EoC (I got asked a question while I was writing this), It's time to do some new shit.. ;)

June 2018
25th June 2018 to 29th June 2018

Landing the planes! Pulling the planes into tarmac! Covering it up forever?? This entire week was full of action.

Had a fun team outing too... ;)

18th June 2018 to 22nd June 2018

Back to work after a long time. Still some semblance of the pain left. But it's more than manageable! Semester ending! Landing few more planes to an Airport already overflowing with previously landed planes... ;)

May 2018
28th May 2018 to 1st June 2018

Vas & Avinash leaving the company today!

Vas is the Biriyani Guy.
Vas is the first person I've seen living truly in the moment, deciding that he has to have Ambur biriyani in Ambur just 30 mins before leaving.
Vas is the last of my mentors to leave. Other being Raghu! Had the most fun working (read arguing stuff) with both of them!!
Vas is very particular about saying & doing the right things. Not allowing any BS.

That leaves us truly alone in the upper echelons of things! Although I've been there from a long time.

Getting nostalgic about the incredibly fun & formative time I had in muRx.

21st May 2018 to 25th May 2018

Monotonous work. Looking forward to the weekend.

14th May 2018 to 18th May 2018

Ramzan is upon us. Expect to see me quietly going about my work, speaking softly.... No sudden bursts of energy consumption..:P Decent week work wise.

7th May 2018 to 11th May 2018

Another week. Another solid build. Work on dockerizing everything. Interesting week.

30th Apr 2018 to 4th May 2018

Decent week work wise. Love the timing change. There are so many positives. Closed lot of pending issues on EoC.

Also this week, celebrated Birthdays of Raiyan & Chepuri!!!

Apr 2018
23rd Apr 2018 to 27th Apr 2018

A week where everything came back to normalcy. Back to EoC. Decent week.

16th Apr 2018 to 20th Apr 2018

There is only one word to describe this week, "INSANITY". Even the last week entry is supposed to read more like, "Let's just keep quiet". Where do I start? I have never felt more aggrieved than what I am feeling right now. 10 days before the Customer Summit and we suddenly want a new Application. I know the work on it started loooong back, but it's like we have built 80% of the application in these last 10 days.

Oh, and I should stop calling it an application, it is a ENTIRE PLATFORM. And we have 10 days to build it. I should have been already used to this by now, but that's a wrong notion to put in our heads. It's inhumane to even have that expectation, and luckily enough I am one of the people who have stretched the least. I feel sorry for all of us who had to go through this. And the sad part is, there can't be any hope that this will change.

With all that said and done, this platform is a good idea and I'm happy to have worked on it. I don't know how Srini does it everytime. Gets things done; rallying everyone around him, even under these circumstances. I dunno whether to feel proud of all the things we have done or feel bad having put myself through this. There is two sides to the coin. The good, Bad and the Ugly.. ;)

This was my first dairy entry where I have poured out my raw unstructured (no bullet points.. :P ) thoughts. This is what it feels to have a dairy I guess.

 

 

Friday the 20th

I just had a one on one with Madhu. I don't like the way we are viewed in the company. He said we are not helping the company in any way, instead I should go to delivery and earn company something. I told him that him viewing us as though we aren't helping anyone is the problem here. You don't value us enough I said.

I told him EoC is being pitched to all the clients as our company's capability. We just hit 1000 users recently. He said it is not helping the company, and that you are sitting in one corner and doing research, you should look to "learn new things", expand your knowledge. Go to MAF team which is building a mobile app for the clients. I said I like what I am working on. I told him I don't want to leave unfinished. I also told him about modelOps, the new platform we are working on. He didn't seem to care about anything we are working on.

If all the one on ones is going to turn into Resource management calls, what's the point of having it at all. I thought he will ask about what problems I am facing, and try to address that. He didn't even get into that. If everyone in the leadership thinks the same way, why don't we shut down this entire division and move everyone to delivery... EARN SOME MONEY! I say they should earn our respect.

update: I loved the fact that Zubin took proper actions about this. #Respect

09th Apr 2018 to 13th Apr 2018
Pulled into working on ModelOps this week.
Don't know what to feel about this one!
02nd Apr 2018 to 06th Apr 2018
Another week another build!! Smooth sailings.
Decent work week.
Mar 2018
26th Mar 2018 to 30th Mar 2018
Missed a crucial week cuz of stomach infection. Glad the build went smooth.
19th Mar 2018 to 23rd Mar 2018
Another Friday another build release, but this time hopefully we wrapped everything up by 11.
Too many features shipping out in this one!!
Amazing to have Chepuri back working with us!!
Overall a great week work wise.
12th Mar 2018 to 17th Mar 2018
Just pushed the build at 1AM Friday night. I feel tired and overworked.
All the features that were supposed to be finished in this entire month, was finished by mid month. Maybe Zubin thinks we are Cyborg.
5th Mar 2018 to 9th Mar 2018
The most satisfying thing that I have done this week is this! See it in Gitlab

It is bye bye Jenkins!! Build and deployment moved to Gitlab CI.

Overall a very fast paced work week, gave out tons of features in a single day on Monday. And then some more in the following days.
Feb 2018
26th Feb to 2nd Mar 2018
I gotta say, I am little relieved to be officially not leading the team. It was getting a little frustrating for me, since I was spending close to 50% of my time doing non-coding work.
I feel at this point in my career, I should continue to excel at coding, and take up managerial work when I get old. :P
UI framework got updated to webpack 4, babel 7, and much more!! It was exciting to keep the framework current with the latest trends out in the world.
Well now, Code away my friend, code away!!
19th Feb 2018 to 23 Feb 2018
Decent week
12th Feb 2018 to 16th Feb 2018
Good week work wise!
I've reinforced the faith in my abilities when I had to do lot of cleanup before working on features for the build.
I've made 28 commits, 1700 line additions & 2700 line deletions in one day!! And all of these changes is just code cleanup to make it more readable/faster & maintainable.
I feel I should have some more time dedicated to all of these. Having code-reviews, writing tests, optimizing existing code as a collaborative effort. Cuz one fine day when I revisit this code back, I would see a lot of ways to improve it. And I would almost always stretch late into the night and do the improv and actual features.

PS: Happy birthday Suz!!

5th Feb 2018 to 9th Feb 2018
Happy Birthday Shondha!!
Had a lot of thoughts & some discussions around how the version 2 of the UI framework should look like.
I finally deprecated the old issue where our daily progress on the UI framework was tracked on a daily basis.
Feeling very very emotional. Some cool shit got documented here along the journey of building the UI framework, with Raghu and Chepuri.!! So long old friend
Jan 2018
29th Jan 2018 to 2nd Feb 2018
Another build, another release. Things are going smooth!
Little bit frustrated since I didn't get to code more, and it was meetings/discussions...
Saw a really good tweet: "If you're a senior developer in the team; If you are not scaling the team, you are failing the team!"
Another gem: Meet Pablo
22nd Jan 2018 to 25th Jan 2018
Had a really good release, satisfied with all the work done!
I am taking this behind the scenes, code cleanup thing very seriously to the extent that I have had to spend extended nights in office to work on the functionality promised. I need to pipe down on it a bit!
15th Jan 2018 to 19 Jan 2018
Pretty much mind f**ked after doing CSS cleanup in the project. This is what happens overtime on projects. See it yourself
This entire week I worked on cleaning up the repo. Making it more maintainable. I achieved zero code duplication!!!
Side by Side I had to work on the feature that was promised, but I managed to pull it off.
8th Jan 2018 to 12th Jan 2018
Great week work-wise. Went full on coding on the EoC app.
Mixed feelings about being made team lead. I was happy just coding!! ;)
Have made a list of lots of performance/speed changes for the EoC app.
Finished code cleanup/refresh for 25% of the code in 2 days!! Good days ahead!
1st Jan 2018 to 5th Jan 2018
I included Jan 1 (Holiday) on purpose..:P I have completed one more year in existence on this earth!!
I have grown immensely in the last year! 2017 was a good year for me.
New year, setting up roadmaps and stuff.
Meanwhile I'm upping the coverage on the codebases.. :)
Cleanups galore!!
I cleaned up my gmail (Have like 10 mails total)
Cleaned Up my chrome bookmarks. Moved most of them to my Awesome Links repository
Had a massive cleanup of UI framework recently. Here Here and Here
Starting on new work for this semester from monday!
Dec 2017
26th Dec 2017 to 29th Dec 2017
On leave
18th Dec 2017 to 22nd Dec 2017
Testcases week! Brought up test case coverage from 50% to 79% in one week!
I'm off from office until next year!!
11th Dec 2017 to 15th Dec 2017
Rolled out "ROBOCOP" finally! People will now be nagged!
Added more teeth to the testing framework, it's now fully fledged! I just hit 100% coverage on bunch of files. Will take time to do that on the entire project.. ;)
4th Dec 2017 to 8th Dec 2017
Released my own custom Alfresco Query Language (AQL) for serving the purpose of Generating Custom Reports of EoC Data. Check out this bad boy over here
Will work next week on creating a simple dashboard that will help generate any sort of reports they want about the current content in EoC.
Finished working on setting up the Calling API for scheduling torture to people who are lazy/ignorant to read their mails and complete tasks on time.
Will release this fury next week. Watch out!!
Nov 2017
27th Nov 2017 to 1st Dec 2017
Was on leave on Monday
Came on Tuesday, and started and finished making changes for the next day's build.
After all these years, we still come down to the last day before build to make all the changes hurriedly
I wish we will be better at adjudicating how much work can be taken and completed within the given timeline
Release went smoothly without much troubles. We were able to finish on time.
Post release I have been getting some ad-hoc requests from the House Bricks team
They keep asking for list of files in the system created after XXX date, or list of files that are there in Ready for Review folder.
I want some person from their team to sit with me, I will walk him/her through a generic script to do this.
Post that they should be able to tweak the generic script to fulfill all their requests without disturbing us.
Next thing I want to talk about is the pace of the Content creation
We don't have proper content in the system, but we want a separate intelligent system to tell them to read their mails, follow up on their tasks, call and notify them?
Are they that lazy to go read their mails? Every single task that gets created, mail goes to the individual asking for following up on their tasks.
If a small team that is creating content cannot follow up and finish up their tasks, then we can forget about rolling this out to the entire org.
The rigor has to come from within, we don't have to go crazy about adding all futuristic stuff to the system.
20th Nov 2017 to 24th Nov 2017
Decent week workwise
13th Nov 2017 to 16th Nov 2017
Nothing to say
6th Nov 2017 to 10th Nov 2017
Got suddenly pulled into the workflows for an urgent task for setting up muAoPS upload part from Alfresco
Rolled it out in the build.
A little shaky start to the work post the build release.
2nd Nov 2017 to 3rd Nov 2017
Was on leave
Oct 2017
30th Oct 2017 to 31th Oct 2017
Wrapped up the new testing framework!! Good progress! Go Jest!
Off from Wednesday till next Monday! Extended weekend!!
16th Oct 2017 to 19th Oct 2017
Great week, working on UI framework.
Revamped the testing setup and released first cut version.
9th Oct 2017 to 13th Oct 2017
This has been an amazing experience for the last two weeks, leading an entire product.
Maybe I am overthinking this, but I had a great time working with everyone (bar some), so I take this opportunity to thank you all. (Is this sounding like a goodbye mail? It's not..:P)
We had two releases in the same week on CORP. Both went fine.. ;) (Another way of saying below expectations)
Was mostly involved in meetings/discussions which I don't like that much. (I prefer coding) But I will take this as a good experience.
Greatly looking forward to the next week, when I will be back orchestating a symphony with the "keywords" and "literals" interwoven through logic!!
2nd Oct 2017 to 6th Oct 2017
So, first week in absence of Srini. Things went better than what I was appraised off.
Had to manage EoC tool, Workflows and other related stuff. So far it is going pretty well..:)
Throughout the week I didn't get to code and it was mostly talks and guiding others. It was not as bad as I had thought.
Sept 2017
25th Sept to 29th Sept
One more person out of team, Arun. Team is shrinking day by day while the feature list is growing.
Even if we get new people, it's time consuming to ramp them up. It will take time for them to contribute anything meaningfully.
This week was involved in everything Srini is involved in, I have to represent him for the next 2 weeks.
18th Sept to 22nd Sept
Was allotted to work on the UI framework to revamp the testing setup, didn't get to do it so far.
Got stuck with coverage not generating in the old setup, I had to figure out the entire old setup to root out the problem and solve it. Was very much convinced we need a new testing setup.
Now am helping the rest of the team with their doubts/helps/explainations/discussions on how to write test cases.
Out of 9 hrs in the day, I'm getting close to 1-2 hrs doing actual coding. So it's moving slow!!
11th Sept to 15th Sept
Little bit tough week personally, since one of my closer friends is leaving the company.
4th Sept to 8th Sept
Writing this at 2:30 AM Saturday morning, Only thing on my mind right now is the final outcome of the troubles we faced, lessons learned is Here.
This week somehow we managed to bring everything together on the EOC tool. Pretty much satisfied with the week.
Hoping our work is received well!! ;)
August 2017
28th Aug to 1st Sept
Tough week to begin with, with lot on my plate - working alone on UI & Backend, at the same time helping teammates with their doubts, mentoring 2 new folks. Felt overworked.
Decided to be focused on one thing, "code". Both on the UI and Backend.
Was going in a decent pace, felt like I was working alone (except for maybe Suz) even though we had 12 member team, since everyone else were ramping up on the framework.
The day of the demo (Friday) lots of thing screwed up. It was the day that even defined process (Jenkins) chose to fcuk up. Felt completely responsible for it.
Spent time yesterday (Saturday) amongst the festivities to figure out once and for all why the backend was dying. And turns out node version 6 had a bug that was screwing us all these days. Fixed it. Now it's completely stable.
Looking forward to put a strong foot forward on the tool from Monday!!
21st Aug to 25th Aug
Started the week a little slow, a little too much easy going than I should have
With the new team, came a huge load of responsibilities since I started being surrounded with people asking for help.
Again have to go back into the old way of balancing the work and help so that I can deliver as much as I can. They learn fast. Hopefully I'll get more time to my work as we proceed.
Things started to get onto the fast track quickly, and as always, a boatload of last minute changes started coming in. You think people would be clairvoyant after going through the same thing over and over again, but No!!
Anyways we are able to keep up with it. And hopefully I can wrap up all the changes by Wednesday next week. I have to go home on Thursday evening on the account of Bakrid!!
16th Aug to 18th Aug
Clouds have cleared and presented us with new team and a new challenge to work for. Looking forward to it.
Though it was a small week work wise (2.5 days), we laid down small foundation for the September release.
7th Aug to 9th Aug
Lot of uncertainty over what sort of work we will be doing next.
Hoping all that get cleared over within the start of next week. Doesn't bode well for me if there is a lot of uncertainty.
31st July to 4th Aug
Got to work on UI framework! Made lot of perf improvements. And reduced a lot of build size!!
Bundle size reduced from 1.3MB to 300KB on Delivery Engine UI just by updating from framework side!
Two new people joined to take over and we began teaching them UI framework...;)
July 2017
24th July to 28th July
Casual week, nothing too exciting.
17th July to 21th July
Came of an awesome weekend with all the family members and friends after a long time.
Went through another cycle of realizing having social life is also important along with professional and personal. Hopefully I act on it before I go through another cycle of realization of the same.
Wrapped up EoC delivery engine UI. Proud of this baby!!
Fingers crossed on the Summit demo, should have to stay back today for support. Hopefully everything goes well.
10th July to 14th July
Forgot to write the dairy last week, was busy on the weekend with some family function. Should definitely write dairy on Friday and cannot take it home.
Got moving on the fast paced development cycles for EoC
3rd July to 7th July
Work now seems to settle back into normal, and slowly started to get interesting like before.
Restarted Phoenix UI framework. Our middletier architecture was pitched to a client and is on the verge of acceptance. Finally seeing the fruits of all the good work we put into Phoenix!
Got to clear out another mirage, getting comfortable with D3.

All in all, Promising week

June 2017
27th June to 30th June
Came off Ramzan in a very flashy dress, why be boring, be different. I've decided I'll do one different thing every week.
Everything was finalized on what we wanted to do for the EoC, so shifted to top gears!!
Whipped up a nice and smooth UI using Phoenix UI Framework (My baby)
Everything is going smooth and going well. I am happy..:P
19th June to 22nd June
I wonder why my documentation habits starts to influence my diary being written in bullet points. Well maybe this is how one should live their life, To The Point
Well this week felt good to be back working on a project, EoC for the customer summit.
Even though it's kinda expected that the nature of work is very fluctuating, I guess we should be doing fine from next week!
Big weekend ahead of me, with Ramzan around the corridor!! So, enthu level is through the roof for this one!! :P
9th June to 16th June
No interesting work this week, waiting to start Real Coding
All adhoc based work, helps me practice pattern recognition and pattern replication.
Psyched to start work on the EoC UI for Customer summit [Any real coding work would have made me happy.. ;)]

 

Everything till 9th June

Time leading upto the end of this week was very rocky emotionally, beginning with the fear of "Not getting to be in proper development"(just to tone it down), to actually getting relieved that I will be a part of the new D.I.E experience

Don't know whether to be excited or sad.

Extremely sad that Phoenix is being shut down (or is it?:P).
It was a huge learning curve, and reinforces my self confidence in solving any problems that we face. (We built a UI framework abstraction for god sakes..:D)
I'm a very optimistic person, so looking forward to have really good experience in the new setup.

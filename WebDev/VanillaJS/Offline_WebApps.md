## The need

* We need to be considering offline approach for the following reasons:
  * to be able to use apps even with flaky connection (cell network in a train)
  * to be able to work without network connection (on an airplane)
  * to boost the performance
  
## Standards?

* Google is defining concept called [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)
* They have come up with a simple checklist which is exhaustive. [Link](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist)
* Tool to test your app for performance. [LightHouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)

> Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any page on the web. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.

## Types of testing

* Static Code Analysis - ESLint (without style specific rules) & FlowType - Easy to setup, good ROI
* Unit testing(Jest) - Testing Individual components without having to worry about external deps
* Integration testing(Jest) - Testing many components working together
* End to end tests(Cypress)- Treating app as a blackbox and testing it from user perspective

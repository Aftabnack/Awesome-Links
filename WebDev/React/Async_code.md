# Call libraries

### [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

* Built to work on both Web (XMLHttpRequest) and node (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Promise based API. Keep chaining the thens..:P
* Auto resolves all the responses (`response.json().then()`)
* Resolves response with error status into reject/catch block
* Provides you a way in which you can maintiain defaults across requests globally/instance-specfic which can be overridden when making the call
* Provides request/response interceptors to do what you want before making a request/as soon as you get the response.
* Only two dependancies on the package.

### [Request](https://github.com/request/request)

* This is a worthy challenger to Axios.
* Won't go into much details on it

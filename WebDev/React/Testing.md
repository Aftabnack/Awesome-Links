# Test cases

### Jest

* Testing framework, initially made only for React, now has been improved very much.
* Feature that I like most? [Snapshot Testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html) You do not need to write more than one test-case for your static UI!!
* Also has a pretty awesome CLI!
* Also love the preprocessor system, Jest uses that to even remap the coverage properly!! (Wrote preprocessor for phoenix)
* Enzyme is a really good library to combine with Jest!!

### Random

* [Headless chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) makes an entry into the fray.

## Grid layouting [CheatSheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

* CSS Grid layout has been designed to provide a two-dimensional layout method for CSS, with the ability to lay out items in rows and columns.
* A CSS grid can be used to achieve many different layouts.
* It excels at dividing a page into major regions, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.
* Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. 
* However, unlike tables, grid layout doesn't have content structure, therefore enabling a wide variety of layouts not possible in tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.

* Flexible boxes, or flexbox, is a new layout mode in CSS3.
* Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
* For many applications, the flexible box model provides an improvement over the block model in that it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its contents.

## Grid layouting [Link](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

* CSS Grid layout has been designed to provide a two-dimensional layout method for CSS, with the ability to lay out items in rows and columns.
* A CSS grid can be used to achieve many different layouts.
* It excels at dividing a page into major regions, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.
* Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. 
* However, unlike tables, grid layout doesn't have content structure, therefore enabling a wide variety of layouts not possible in tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.
